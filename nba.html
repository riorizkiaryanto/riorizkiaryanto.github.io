        <h1>Exploring Player Similarities: Clustering NBA Players</h1>

        <div class="overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>During my master's degree program, I undertook a project aimed at <span class="highlight">exploring and implementing machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios</span>. 
                Being passionate about basketball and intrigued by sport science, I choose a topic related to the NBA. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My project focused on utilizing machine learning, specifically clustering, to analyze NBA players. I <span class="highlight">segmented players into distinct groups based on similarities in 
                their statistics</span>. The inspiration behind this project stemmed from a statement made by an NBA coach suggesting that the traditional five positions in basketball could 
                be condensed into two or three groups. This piqued my curiosity, driving me to investigate these proposed groupings and their relevance using clustering models.

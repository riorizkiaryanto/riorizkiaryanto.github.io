            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>In this personal project, I embarked on <span class="highlight">analyzing Netflix and TV show data</span> sourced from IMDb via Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/netflix-top-rated-movies-and-tv-shows-2020-2022" target="_blank">here</a>. Leveraging a <span class="highlight">Gaussian Mixture clustering model</span>, I segmented the dataset into Top (Recommended) and Non-Top rated categories. The objective was to delve into the data, extract insights, and subsequently visualize them using Looker Studio to create captivating infographics</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The primary challenge in this project lies in <span class="highlight">effectively compiling the outcomes of the clustering model</span> into an interactive and engaging Looker Studio dashboard.</p>

                    <h2>1. Ideations</h2>
                    <p>Given the utilization of a public dataset, it was imperative to meticulously explore the data points that aligned with the project objectives. 
                        This step was crucial to ensure the execution of unnecessary data from the model. Subsequently, understanding the dataset enabled the compilation of a 
                        coherent narrative to convey the project's essense effectively.

                    <h2>2. Development</h2>
                    <p>I opted to develop a Gaussian Mixture clustering model as a learning opportunity, as I was not yet familiar with the algorithm and sought to gain 
                        insights into its functionality. The model was implemented using Python, and the clustering results were stored in Google Sheets for visualization purposes 
                        utilizing Looker Studio.

                    <h2>3. Visualization</h2>
                    <p>The concluding stage involved designing the dashboard using Looker Studio. The primary objective was to present the narrative in a user-friendly format 
                        while ensuring interactivity. Users are provided with an interactive platform to utilize the model and explore various insights derived from each cluster generated 
                        by the Gaussian Mixture model.

            <p>Personally, I am highly satisfied with the project's outcomes. Not only did I have the opportunity to delve into Gaussian Mixture clustering, but it also marked my first 
                encounter with the renowed Netflix and IMDb datasets. This project served as an enriching experience, allowing me to expand my knowledge significantly. Moreover, I found 
                the entire process to be quite enjoyable.

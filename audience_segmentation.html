                One challenge our client faces as their audience expands is <span class="highlight">identifying the appropriate target audience</span> for their marketing campaigns. They regularly 
                conduct newsletter campaigns, with some aimed at <span class="highlight">increasing brand awareness in the market</span>. With their audience continually growing, they must pinpoint 
                specific demographics to target with their newsletter.

                Initially, I purposed creating audience segmentation to gather insights into the characteristics of each group. This would enable us to determine which group best aligns with 
                the newsletter's objectives. However, a challenge arose as the client <span class="highlight">lacked sufficient diverse data</span>. They only possessed data on audience activities from past campaigns. 
                To address this, I developed a clustering model using the K-Means algorithm for audience segmentation. Additionally, I created a Recency Frequency and Monetary (RFM) model as 
                a comparison to the inital data model.

                Utilizing the first model-K-Means clustering model-we observed a <span class="highlight">threefold improvement in digital marketing campaign performance</span>, 
                marking a significant enhancement. However, for the second model employing the RFM algoritm, we have yet to conduct a real case study 
                to test its effectiveness.

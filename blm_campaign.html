        <h1>Insights into Public Perception: Black Lives Matter Campaign Analysis</h1>

        <div class="overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                One of the topics I learnied during my master's degree program was the use of the Spark platform for efficient data processing. One of the assignments given at that time was to 
                implement Spark in real-world situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                At that time, the Black Live Matter campaign was happening worldwide. It caught my attention, so I chose to address this topic by <span class="highlight">utilizing Spark to gather data from Twitter</span> 
                social media as the main data sourc.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="challenges">
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Not only did I use Spark, but I also chose to utilize SparkNLP, a library specifically designed for processing data related to NLP. Initially, using both felt challenging because 
                I didn't have prior experience. It took some time to learn both before I could efficiently implement them into code. And I needed to complete this step quickly before 
                losing the momentum related to the Black Live Matters campaign on social media.

                    <h2>2. Development</h2>
                    <p>Write the code in Python. Basically the code will process below:</p>
                    <p>1. Collect the data from Twitter</p>
                    <p>2. For every new data entry, the system will run a sentiment analysis using Stanford NLP model</p>
                    <p>3. Store the Twitter and sentiment result into database</p>

                The final outcoume of this project was the <span class="highlight">of the research in the international conference</span> titled IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering. 
                Additionally, I had the opportunity to present as a speaker at the conferece, sharing my experience in using Spark and SparkNLP to analyze data from the Black Live Matter 
                campaign. Find the publication <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/1077/1/012005" target="_blank">here.</a>
